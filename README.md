Root: The topmost node of the tree, from which all other nodes are descended.

Parent and Child: A node in a binary tree may have zero, one, or two children. A node with children is referred to as a parent, and the nodes it is connected to are its children.

Leaf: A leaf is a node with no children, i.e., it is a node that does not have any outgoing edges.

Internal Node: An internal node is a node with one or more children, excluding the root.

Depth: The depth of a node in a binary tree is the number of edges in the path from the root to that node.

Height: The height of a binary tree is the maximum depth of any node in the tree. It represents the length of the longest path from the root to a leaf.

Binary Search Tree (BST): A binary search tree is a type of binary tree where the values in the left subtree are less than or equal to the value of the root node, and the values in the right subtree are greater than the root's value. This property makes binary search trees efficient for searching and sorting operations.

Traversals: Binary trees can be traversed in different ways, including in-order traversal (left, root, right), pre-order traversal (root, left, right), and post-order traversal (left, right, root).

Balanced Binary Tree: A balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the height of the left and right subtrees of any node differs by at most one. Examples of balanced binary trees include AVL trees and Red-Black trees.
